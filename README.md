## ‚ú¶ Introduction
With the intensification of climate change and urbanization, urban flooding possesses a growing threat for cities globally, especially those located in proximity to hydrological sources. 

While the warming of the atmosphere and oceans are often placed at the forefront of climate change, implications concerning the phenomenon are not limited to increasing temperatures and rather encompass a spectrum of direct and indirect effects. Foremost, metrological conditions, numerous societal sectors, and natural ecosystems will all bear the impact of climate change. Warmer temperature conditions will accelerate the rate of evaporation, thus enhancing the availability of water vapor; this trend will cater towards more probable precipitation and extreme weather events. In combination, rapid urbanization world-wide introduces another point of vulnerability. As such, many urban areas do not retain adequate drainage systems, and the increase in various impervious surfaces (i.e., roads, developed land) will magnify any potential flooding events. In addition, an increase in urban populations places more individuals at risk. 

Nevertheless, historically marginalized groups are often confided to areas with rather poor housing conditions and are segregated to extents within floodplains. Therefore, understanding how land use patterns contribute to general flood risk, and how these risks intersect with various sociodemographic factors, is crucial for developing equitable, climate-resilient cities. 

### ‚úß Objective
This study, hence, aims to evaluate the general relationship between land use and flood hazards in selected [coastal] cities, and assessing whether certain sociodemographic groups are more vulnerability to these risks.

## ‚ú¶ Conclusion & Next Steps

Development alone (i.e., the 'built' environment, etc.) does not ‚Äú*cause*‚Äù flooding in the sense of generating storms, rain, or sea level rise. However, it does increases vulnerability and severity of impacts. Furthermore, local topography plays a crucial role in flood risk.

Racial disparities in flood vulnerability were evident in **Boston** but not in **Providence**, suggesting that the relationship between race and flood risk is shaped by local patterns of segregation, development, and infrastructure investment.

Future resilience efforts should prioritize equitable adaptation, integrating land use planning, green infrastructure, and community-driven strategies to reduce both physical and social vulnerabilities to flooding.

**Future research** should target: 
- Testing accuracy of models (i.e., HAND) & improving quality
- Checking trends of racial disparities in different cities
- Expanding to other sociodemographic factors (i.e., poverty, ownership, income)
